## Long-Term Burnout Prevention Strategies

> Burnout prevention isn't about working harder ‚Äî it's about working smarter and protecting your energy.

- **Set Clear Boundaries**: Define start/end times. Don't be "always available."  
- **Say No**: Politely but firmly decline unnecessary tasks and meetings.  
- **Schedule Recovery**: Build regular breaks into your week ‚Äî not just vacations.  
- **Balance Workload**: Mix heavy tasks with lighter ones. Avoid "all deadlines, all the time."  

üí° *Tip: Sustainability > intensity.*

## Handling Workplace Social Pressure Without Losing Yourself

You don't have to attend every happy hour or answer every Slack ping immediately.

- **Participate selectively**: quality over quantity.  
- Use polite phrases to exit conversations:  
  
  > "Thanks! I need to jump back into a deadline."  
- Block **"focus time"** visibly on your calendar.  

üí° *Tip: You‚Äôre allowed to protect your energy without apology.*
