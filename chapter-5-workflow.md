## Time Management Techniques for Introverts


**Key techniques:**

- **Deep Work**: Block 1‚Äì2 hours for complex writing tasks without interruptions.  
- **Pomodoro Technique**: Work in 25- or 50-minute focused sprints, followed by short breaks.  
- **Batching Tasks**: Group similar tasks (research, writing, editing) to reduce mental switching.  

üí° *Tip: Protect your mornings for deep work when possible ‚Äî your brain is fresher.*

## Automating Documentation Workflows

> Small automations = big energy savings.

**Examples:**

- **Templates**: Standardize documentation structure (user guides, API docs, FAQs).  
- **Version Control**: Use Git for documentation to track changes without endless email chains.  
- **AI Tools**: Summarize long notes, auto-generate outlines, speed up proofreading.  

üí° *Tip: Anything you repeat 3+ times deserves a template.*
